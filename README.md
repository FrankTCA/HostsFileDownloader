This repository downloads the hosts.txt file only once per day (to prevent DDoS)

The hosts file is available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts">here</a>

Thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole">PiHole project</a> for inspiration

Additional thanks to <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack">StevenBlack</a> for the file itself.
